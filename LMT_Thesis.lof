The materials from left to right: Granite tile, Steel wool, Coarse foam, Oak, Fine foam. Simulation starts at the center directly across the objects where interactions can easily be performed by the users. At the beginning, original signals are activated for all materials. Users can switch with P-key to LPC synthesized signals, with K-key to IFFT-transformed signals and with M-key to signals generated via the major frequencies. The user speed is detected during interaction and the corresponding sound is displayed according to the speed interval. Users control the grey ball in the picture with the haptic device to explore and interact with objects.}}{23}
