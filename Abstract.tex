Several decades of research have been dedicated to the representation of real interactions in virtual or remote environments. Haptic interfaces give the possibility to touch virtual objects and to produce sensations during texture exploration by sliding a hand-held tool across a textured surface. This process elicits perceptual information about the properties of a texture based on the data recorded from real interactions. This thesis describes mathematical models for synthesizing acceleration signals at different velocities of a user during the surface exploration. These acceleration signals are then used for producing audio data to present microscopic roughness of a texture. The application of Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) is shown for interpolating between signals. Furthermore, computing recorded signals' major frequencies to predict acceleration data is introduced as another possible method for switching between audio recordings when the user's scanning speed changes. For both cases, high correlations are obtained between the predicted and recorded data without creating perceptually noticeable artifacts.
